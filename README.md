# StatsBomb JSON Pipeline Exploration

This repository contains exploratory work using StatsBomb open event data.  
The purpose of this project is to understand football event data at the raw JSON level in order to design an end to end analytics pipeline for an MSc Data Analytics in Sport thesis.

## Objectives
- Understand the structure of StatsBomb JSON event, lineup, and match data
- Explore how football events are represented conceptually
- Convert raw JSON into analysis ready formats
- Create basic exploratory visualisations
- Define pipeline input assumptions for future data integration

## Data Source
StatsBomb Open Data  
https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for exploration and visualisation  
- `notes/` – Written notes on data structure and pipeline concepts  
- `data_raw/` – Small sample JSON files only  
- `outputs/` – Generated plots and tables  
- `src/` – Helper scripts (if needed)

## Context
This work supports the early methodology and pipeline design phase of a final MSc thesis focused on applied football analytics.
